This is a simple python script which takes in an input "urls_input.xlsx" which should be an excel file containing a column labelled "URL" containing a list of your saved AutoTrader listings.
The first time the script is ran, it will create an output file "autotrader_data.xlsx" which will contain the URLs, Make, and Price of your listings with the current date.
Any further runs will append to the already existing file a column with the current date as well as the most recent prices.
