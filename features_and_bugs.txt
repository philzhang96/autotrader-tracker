Features to be added:
13/01/2025:
    <s>Scrape price from hardcoded URL<s>

12/02/2025:
    Iterate this information such that historical prices can be tracked in the sheet
    Change it such that the URLs no longer have to be hardcoded and can be added through some GUI

16/02/2025:
    Add feature to take the URLs from a single "Saved" URL from AutoTrader instead of having to hardcode them
    If the listing has been deleted (as car has been sold or otherwise), update the CSV accordingly.





Bugs to be fixed:
16th Feb 2025:
1. If the advert has a "Reserved Now" button, this seems to stop the scraper from working
2. The scraper will be able to generate a CSV if  one already exists, need to fix this to update already existing CSV.
